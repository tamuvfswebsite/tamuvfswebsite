# Documentation Plan

| Documentation Plan |   |   |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Type** | **Strategy** | **In charge** |
| System (e.g., how to transfer admin privileges, how to backup) | Create an internal admin guide stored in a document to be transferred with the finished app; include procedures to transfer ownership, and reset configurations. | N/A |
| Installation / Set-up   | Provide step-by-step setup instructions using an Installation tab in the online help section, and a separate failsafe document on how to restart the system. |  N/A |
| User Documentation. Will you provide context sensitive help (in the actual view)? – THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE ONLINE HELP, NOT A SEPARATE DOCUMENT THAT CAN GET MISPLACED | Implement context-sensitive help within the app (e.g., tooltips, “?” icons), explaining fields, forms, error messages, and navigation. Accessible from every page. | N/A |
| Other References |  Include a **References** section in the online Help page listing: – Application URL (deployment link) – GitHub repository for version control – API documentation and Google OAuth configuration guide – Contact information for the support period (email or issue tracker link) – System uptime monitoring link (if applicable) | N/A |
